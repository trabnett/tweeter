# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This is a project for Lighthouse lab students to build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills. I personally found this to be a fun and satisfying project, dispite it's challenges.
